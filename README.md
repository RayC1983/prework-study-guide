# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide was designed to help me keep track of all the in formation that has been provided within the 3 modules.

I built this project for guidance and note taking purposes for myself as well other possible fellow colleagues who will go through prework.

The problem that this prework study guide solves is the issue of not having a place to store all of the pertinent information provided during prework.

I learned so much durig buidling this website about the different languages of coding, repositories, commands, and repettitive systems that go along with coding. The most important thing to me that I learned is that I am developer and I do have it what it takes to be a great one!
